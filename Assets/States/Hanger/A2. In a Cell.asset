  storyText: "Well, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal beating and end up
    dumped in a dirty cell. \r\nThe bars are thick cast iron. The door is old and
    patched together with plate metal and thick red wires. \r\nYou have no idea where
    you are. And your head hurts. \r\n\r\nSo, what to do now, slugger?\r\n\t1. Wait
    it out. My head hurts.\r\n\t2. Slam into the door with all my might."
