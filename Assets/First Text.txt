Festers, Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered longed rocks flingers. At least 10 of them guarding the hanger door. Typical.

Could try punching my way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.

What should I do?
1.Take them head on 1o guards.
2. Sneak my way through to the emergency exit.


Well, that clearly wasn't the right choice. You failed. 

No parade for you. Want to try again?
1. Yes, this time I shall taste glory.
2. No, I'm going to go sulk for a while.


Welcome to this game. Its a choose your own adventure. Be careful what you wish for!
At each stage you'll be asked to push a key on the keyboard,for example 1 or 2 or 3.
At any point in time, push "q" to quit. Push "1" to continue...


Well, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal beating and end up dumped in a dirty cell. 
The bars are thick cast iron. The door is old and patched together with plate metal and thick red wires. 
You have no idea where you are. And your head hurts. 

So, what to do now, slugger?
	1. Wait it out. My head hurts.
	2. Slam into the door with all my might.

Okay, you're around the corner. No one can see you. You think.
Bit tough to hear yourself think above the thumping machinery. 
However, in front of you is the emergency exit door. 
It has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging from a bolted handle. 
You could try picking the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry it off.

What to do?
	1. Pick it.
	2. Pry it.


You give it a good 10 minutes. No dice. Not going to happen. 
You do realise that you have no idea how to pick a lock right? 
You're an airship pilot,  not a common thief. 

So what now?
1. Fine, try to pry it
